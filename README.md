## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains the complete code, assets, and content for my portfolio site. The site showcases my skills, projects, résumé, and contact information. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Your browser fetches these static files, so there is no backend server required.  
My goals for this site include:

- Presenting a clean, responsive, and professional portfolio  
- Highlighting my projects and work in a visually engaging way  
- Making it easy for visitors (e.g. potential employers, collaborators) to explore and contact me  
- Maintaining a lightweight, maintainable site that I can evolve over time

## 🎯 How to Run / Preview Locally

If you’d like to work on or view the site locally before pushing changes:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Luke1432/luke1432.github.io.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.  
   (Since this is a static site, no server is required.)
3. Edit files (`.html`, `.css`, `.js`, images) as needed.
4. Commit changes and push to the `main` (or `master`) branch — GitHub Pages will automatically update the live site.

If you prefer, you can also serve it through a simple local HTTP server (to avoid CORS or local file path issues), for example:

```bash
# Python 3
cd path/to/repo
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```
